   calibratable object
       Component that provides the "true" values associated with a calibration sample

   codec
   variable codec
       One-to-one mapping between event codes and their associated variables

   component codec
       One-to-one mapping between numeric component identifiers and component names

   event
       Trio consisting of an event code, time, and value.  Primarily used to announce changes to variable values in the event stream.

   event code
       Integer code associated with an event.  Typically identifies the variable whose value has changed, although some system event codes have no associated variable.

   event file
       On-disk copy of the event stream.  Contains a record of everything that happened in an experiment, as indicated by changes to variable values.

   event stream
       Stream of events generated by a running experiment.  Provides continuous updates on the state of the experiment to MWClient and other online observers.  Stored in the event file for offline analysis.

   selectable object
       Component that supports selection-related actions (e.g. `Accept Selections`).  `Protocol`, `Block`, `Trial`, `List`, and `Selection Variable` are all selectable objects.
