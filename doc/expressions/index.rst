Expressions
===========

MWorks' expression language should feel familiar to anyone who has used programming or scripting languages before.  The following sections describe it in detail.


Literals
--------

The expression parser recognizes literal values for a variety of data types.

=====================  ============  ===================  ==============  ==========

Note that the unit operators and the plain-English logical operators (``not``, ``and``, and ``or``) are not case-sensitive.  However, the type-conversion operators and all operators that begin with ``#`` (``#LT``, ``#AND``, etc.) *are* case-sensitive.

Also, be aware that the division operator (``/``) always produces a floating-point result, even if both of its operands are integers.  For example, ``1/2`` evaluates to 0.5, not 0 (as it does in some programming languages).


Units
^^^^^

Since MWorks does not provide true support for quantities with associated units, the unit operators are simply shorthand for multiplication operations.  In the case of time units (``us``, ``ms``, and ``s``), the operators multiply by a factor suitable for converting to microseconds (1, 1000, and 1000000, respectively).


Subscripting
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the expression ``exp`` evaluates to a list, then ``exp[n]`` returns the element at index *n*.  If *n* is out of bounds, the expression evaluates to zero, and the parser issues an error message.  (Note that the first element of a list is at index 0, *not* 1.)

If the expression ``exp`` evaluates to a dictionary, then ``exp[k]`` returns the value associated with key *k* in the dictionary.  If the dictionary has no matching key, the expression evaluates to zero, and the parser issues an error message.


Precedence
^^^^^^^^^^

The above table lists the operators from highest precedence (1) to lowest precedence (9).  Operator precedence determines the order of operations in expressions, as higher-precedence operations are evaluated before lower-precedence ones.

The order of operations can be altered by wrapping sub-expressions in parentheses, which have higher precedence than all other operators.  For example, ``*`` has higher precedence than ``+``, so ``1+2*3`` evaluates to 7, but ``(1+2)*3`` evaluates to 9.


.. _Range Expressions:

Ranges
------

A range expression is a compact representation of an evenly-spaced, ordered sequence of integers.

The general form of a range expression is *start:stop:step*, where *start*, *stop*, and *step* are expressions that evaluate to integers.  *step* is optional.  If provided, it must evaluate to a positive integer; if omitted, it defaults to 1.  If *start* is less than *stop*, the sequence will be increasing; otherwise, it will be decreasing.  *start* is always included in the sequence.  If *start* and *stop* are separated by a multiple of *step*, *stop* will be included as well.

List literals, function calls, and `selection variable <Selection Variable>` value lists can all incorporate range expressions.  In all cases, range expressions can be mixed with other expressions, so long as all items are separated by commas.

The following table shows some examples of range expression usage, with equivalent, range-expression-free versions shown alongside.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Expression
     - Equivalent

   * - ``[1:5]``
     - ``[1,2,3,4,5]``

   * - ``f(2:-1)``
     - ``f(2,1,0,-1)``

   * - ``3:10:2``
     - ``3,5,7,9``

   * - ``[9:0:3]``
     - ``[9,6,3,0]``

   * - ``f(3:3)``
     - ``f(3)``

   * - ``7,2:4,-5,9:5:2,1``
     - ``7,2,3,4,-5,9,7,5,1``


Variables
---------

MWorks variables can be incorporated into expressions by referencing each variable by its name.  For example, if your experiment defines two variables, ``x`` and ``y``, which hold the values 1 and 2, respectively, then the expression ``3*x+y`` will evaluate to 5.

Variable names are case-sensitive, so ``myvar``, ``MYVAR``, and ``MyVar`` all refer to different variables.


Selection
^^^^^^^^^

When used in an expression, a `selection variable <Selection Variable>` evaluates to the currently-selected value.  If no selections have been made on the variable, the first one is made automatically, and its value is returned.


Timer
^^^^^

MWorks `timers <Start Timer>` are implemented as variables.  When used in an expression, the name of a timer evaluates to true if the timer has expired, false otherwise.

*Note*: ``timer_expired`` (see `Time-Related`_ functions below) actually just passes its input value unchanged.  However, using it may help to clarify the intent of an expression.


.. _Variable and Expression Interpolation:

Variable and Expression Interpolation
-------------------------------------

A string literal can incorporate the value of one or more variables via variable interpolation.  When a string literal containing placeholder text of the form ``$var`` or ``${var}`` is evaluated, the placeholder is replaced with the current value of variable ``var`` (converted to a string).  For example::

    var greeting = 'Hello'
    var subject = 'World'

    var message = '$greeting, ${subject}!'  // message contains "Hello, World!"

To inhibit variable interpolation, preface the dollar sign with a backslash::

    var text = '123\$abc'  // text contains "123$abc"

A string literal may also incorporate the value of one or more expressions via expression interpolation.  When a string literal containing placeholder text of the form ``$(expr)`` is evaluated, the placeholder is replaced with the result of evaluating the expression, converted to a string.  For example::

    message = '1 + 2 = $(1 + 2)'  // message contains "1 + 2 = 3"
    text = '$(round(pi())) is a magic number'  // text contains "3 is a magic number"

As with variable interpolation, expression interpolation can be inhibited by prefacing the dollar sign with a backslash::

    text = '123\$abc\$(whee!)'  // text contains "123$abc$(whee!)"


Functions
---------

The expression parser recognizes a number of pre-defined functions, many of which are found in other programming or scripting languages.  Note that function names are *not* case sensitive, so ``now()``, ``NOW()``, and ``Now()`` are all equivalent.
