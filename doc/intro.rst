Introduction
============

MWorks is a suite of applications and libraries for designing and running realtime experiments, particularly in the domains of psychology and neurophysiology.

It provides high-level tools for specifying experimental flow, including hierarchical constructs such as `blocks <Block>` and `trials <Trial>`, as well as finite state machine constructs like `states <Task System State>` and `transitions <Transitions>`.  It enables fine control over a wide range of `input and output devices <Input/Output>`, such as displays, data acquisition systems, and general purpose input/output (GPIO) devices.  In addition, for vision researchers, it includes a rich set of `visual stimuli <Stimuli>`.

MWorks was originally created for conducting visual neurophysiology experiments, but it was designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind.
