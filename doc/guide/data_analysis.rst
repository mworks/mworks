.. _Analyzing Experimental Data:

Analyzing Experimental Data
===========================


Events, Event Stream, and Event File
------------------------------------

The basic unit of MWorks experimental data is the *event*.  An MWorks event consists of an event code, a time stamp, and a value (i.e. the payload).

Most events announce a change in the value of a `variable <Variable>`.  The *codec* (or *variable codec*) provides the mapping between event codes and their associated variables.  Additionally, some `system events <system event codes>` use codes that are not associated with a variable.

The sequence of events generated by a running experiment is called the *event stream*.   The on-disk record of an experiment's event stream is known as the *event file*.


Accessing the Event File
------------------------

Event files are stored on the machine running the MWorks server application (MWServer on macOS, the MWorks app on iOS).


macOS
^^^^^

On macOS, event files are stored in the directory ``$HOME/Documents/MWorks/Data``, where ``$HOME`` is the path to the user’s home directory (e.g. ``/Users/chris``).


iOS
^^^

To access event files stored on iOS, open the `Files <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/files/id1232058109?mt=8>`_ app and navigate to On My iPad ➝ MWorks ➝ MWorks ➝ Data.  From here, you can share one or more event files with a Mac using `AirDrop <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144>`_ or copy them to a cloud storage service like iCloud Drive or Dropbox.  You can also duplicate, move, and delete files.

Alternatively, you can share your event files with a Mac `using iTunes <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301>`_.  However, this is less convenient than using the Files app and requires you to copy the entire "MWorks" subfolder to your computer.


Analyzing the Event File
------------------------

To analyze the results of a completed run of an experiment, you must extract the relevant events from the run's event file.  MWorks provides tools for loading event data in to `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ or `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_.


Using Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Setup
*****

To use MWorks' data analysis tools for Python, you must first make the ``mworks`` package available to your Python code.  You can do this on a per-script basis by adding the directory ``/Library/Application Support/MWorks/Scripting/Python`` to the module search path::

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/Library/Application Support/MWorks/Scripting/Python')

If you want the ``mworks`` package to be available to *all* Python code you run, you can create an ``mworks.pth`` file in your per-user ``site-packages`` directory.  For example, for Python 3.7, execute the following commands in a Terminal window::

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages
    echo '/Library/Application Support/MWorks/Scripting/Python' > ~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/mworks.pth


Opening and Closing
*******************

To open an event file, use the ``MWKFile`` class from the ``mworks.data`` module::

    from mworks.data import MWKFile
    f = MWKFile('my_data.mwk2')
    f.open()

When you are done using the file, you should close it::

    f.close()

Alternatively, you can use the `with statement <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement>`_ to handle opening and closing of the file in an implicit, exception-safe fashion::

    with MWKFile('my_data.mwk2') as f:
        # Analysis code goes here
        ...


Selecting Events
****************

Once the file is open, extract events using the ``get_events`` method.  If called with no arguments, this method returns *all* events in the file::

    all_events = f.get_events()

You can also use keyword arguments to filter events by code or time.  The ``codes`` argument takes a list of event codes or variable names and selects only events with matching codes.  For example, we can extract all events for the variables ``red_selected``, ``green_selected``, and ``blue_selected`` (which appear in the "Find the Circle" example in `Running an Experiment`) like this::

    events = f.get_events(codes=['red_selected', 'green_selected', 'blue_selected'])

The ``time_range`` argument takes a list containing a start time and stop time and selects only events whose time stamps fall within that range::

    events = f.get_events(time_range=[t1, t2])

You can specify both ``codes`` and ``time_range`` to filter on code and time simultaneously.

When analyzing large event files, you may want to extract events one at a time, in order to avoid filling up system memory.  To do this, use the ``get_events_iter`` method.  This method takes the same arguments as ``get_events``.  However, instead of loading all matching events in to a single, list-like object, ``get_events_iter`` returns an `iterator <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator>`_, each iteration of which loads a single event from the data file.  For example, here is how you would use ``get_events_iter`` to process every event::

    for event in f.get_events_iter():
        # Use data from event
        ...


Accessing Event Data
********************

Once you have extracted an event, you can access its event code, time stamp, and value via the ``code``, ``time``, and ``data`` properties of the event object::

    >>> evt = events[0]
    >>> evt.code
    36
    >>> evt.time
    30343102
    >>> evt.data
    0

The ``code`` and ``time`` properties always have integer values.  However, ``data`` can be a boolean, integer, float, string, list, or dictionary::

    >>> events = f.get_events(codes=['#announceMessage'])
    >>> events[15].data
    {'origin': 1, 'message': '4 of 10 trials were correct (68217117)', 'type': 0, 'domain': 0}


Using the Codec
***************

To convert an event code to a variable name, use the ``codec`` property of the ``MWKFile`` object::

    >>> f.codec[36]
    'red_selected'

To convert a variable name to an event code, use the ``reverse_codec`` property::

    >>> f.reverse_codec['red_selected']
    36


Using MATLAB
^^^^^^^^^^^^


Setup
*****

To use MWorks' data analysis tools for MATLAB, you must first add the directory ``/Library/Application Support/MWorks/Scripting/MATLAB`` to the search path::

    addpath('/Library/Application Support/MWorks/Scripting/MATLAB')


Selecting Events
****************

To extract events from an event file, use the ``getEvents`` function.  If called with just the filename, this function returns *all* events in the file::

    all_events = getEvents('my_data.mwk2')

To extract only events with specific event codes, provide an array containing the desired codes as the second argument::

    events = getEvents('my_data.mwk2', [36, 37, 38])

To further restrict the retrieved events to a particular time range, specify a minimum and maximum time as the third and fourth arguments, respectively::

    events = getEvents('my_data.mwk2', [36, 37, 38], t1, t2)

To extract all events in a given time range, pass an empty array as the second argument::

    events = getEvents('my_data.mwk2', [], t1, t2)


Accessing Event Data
********************

The ``getEvents`` function returns a `structure array <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html>`_ containing all selected events.  The event code, time stamp, and value of each event are accessible via the ``event_code``, ``time_us``, and ``data`` fields of each array element::

    >> evt = events(1);
    >> evt.event_code
    
    ans =
    
      int32
    
       36
    
    >> evt.time_us
    
    ans =
    
      int64
    
       30343102
    
    >> evt.data
    
    ans =
    
      int64
    
       0

The ``event_code`` and ``time_us`` fields always have integer values.  However, the type of ``data`` can be logical, integer, floating point, string, `cell <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html>`_, `struct <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html>`_, or `Map <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/map-containers.html>`_::

    >> events = getEvents('my_data.mwk2', [6]);
    >> events(16).data
    
    ans =
    
      struct with fields:
    
        message: '4 of 10 trials were correct (68217117)'
         origin: 1
           type: 0
         domain: 0


Using the Codec
***************

To convert an event code to a variable name, use the Map returned by the ``getCodec`` function::

    >> codec = getCodec('my_data.mwk2');
    >> codec(36)
    
    ans =
    
        'red_selected'

To convert a variable name to an event code, use the Map returned by the ``getReverseCodec`` function::

    >> reverse_codec = getReverseCodec('my_data.mwk2');
    >> reverse_codec('red_selected')
    
    ans =
    
      int64
    
       36
