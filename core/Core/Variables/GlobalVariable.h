 *
 *	The constant variable is a subclass of the Variable object
 *  that carries it's own Datum internal to itself.  This is in contrast
 *  to "normal" Variable objects which are merely symbolic tokens whose
 *  meaning may depend upon what context they reside in.
 *
 *  One function of the constant variable is to allow for truely "constant" 
 *  values (like "4") to be represented as Variables so that other objects in
 *  the system can flexibly use either constant or variable quantities by
 *  refering to the same objects.
 *
 *  The "constant"-ness of constant variables is not absolute, however, and
 *  they can be changed as any other variable would be.  Such changes
 *  actually change the internal Datum of the object, where a "regular" 
 *  variable does not change when the value it symbolically references is 
 *  changed.  Thus, the GlobalVariable primarily provides a different
 *  (and variously useful) means of interacting with the larger variable
 *  handling system.
