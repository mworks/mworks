DDC note:

As of January 2010, DataFileIndexer is the only project in this repository that is actually known to work.  In particular, it can be used to index and read files into Python.  I didn't write any of this code, aside from going into the indexer project and trying salvage something workable.  It is still awkwardly factored, but it definitely works; on a future release it would be nice to clean up with the structure of this code.  

Other groups will probably want to read data files in Matlab; however, while I have carried along the relevant projects from the old MW repositories, I do not use MATLAB anymore and as such am not really well positioned to be maintaining these.

UPDATE 1/25/2010:  Chris Stawarz (cstawarz@mit.edu) from Jim DiCarlo's lab has started keeping an eye on the MATLAB data file reader, and has contributed patches to get it back in fighting shape.  Please contact him if you have any questions about it.
