name: Python File Resource
signature: resource/python_file
isa: Resource
description: |
    A special type of `resource file <Resources>` that contains Python source
    code.

    The file is executed when the experiment loads.  The execution takes place
    after all experiment-defined `variables <Variables>` have been created, but
    before any other components are created.  Therefore, the Python code can set
    variable values or perform additional initialization tasks, and other
    components can make use of the results.

    For information on the modules and functions available to your Python code,
    see `Run Python File`.

    .. rubric:: Available Modules and Functions

    Python code executed by `Run Python File`, `Run Python String`, a `Python
    File Resource`, or the `expression parser <Expressions>` functions
    ``py_eval`` and ``py_call`` can make use of both the `Python standard
    library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>`_ and `NumPy
    <https://www.numpy.org>`_.  In addition, the following MWorks-specific
    functions are available:

    ``getvar(name)``
        Returns the value of an MWorks variable.  ``name`` is a string
        containing the name of the variable.

    ``setvar(name, value)``
        Sets the value of an MWorks variable.  ``name`` is a string containing
        the name of the variable, and ``value`` is the new value to assign.

    ``getcodec()``
        Returns the code-to-name mapping for variables (as a dictionary).

    ``get_reverse_codec()``
        Returns the name-to-code mapping for variables (as a dictionary).

    ``register_event_callback(name, callback)``
        Registers an event callback function for an MWorks variable.  ``name``
        is a string containing the name of the variable, and ``callback`` is a
        Python function as described below.

    ``register_event_callback(code, callback)``
        Registers an event callback function for an MWorks variable.  ``code``
        is the integer code corresponding to the variable, and ``callback`` is a
        Python function as described below.

    ``register_event_callback(callback)``
        Registers an event callback function for *all* MWorks variables.
        ``callback`` is a Python function as described below.  (*Note*: The
        callback function will be invoked very, very frequently.  Use with
        caution!)

    ``unregister_event_callbacks()``
        Unregisters all event callback functions previously registered via
        Python code.

    ``message(msg)``
        Generates a normal MWorks message (like `Report / Message`).  ``msg``
        can be any value, which, after conversion to a string, is used as the
        text of the message.

    ``warning(msg)``
        Generates an MWorks warning message.  ``msg`` can be any value, which,
        after conversion to a string, is used as the text of the message.

    ``error(msg)``
        Generates an MWorks error message.  ``msg`` can be any value, which,
        after conversion to a string, is used as the text of the message.

    Event callback functions are invoked whenever a value is assigned to the
    variable of interest.  They receive a single argument of type ``Event``,
    which has attributes ``code``, ``time``, and ``data``.  The values of
    ``code`` and ``time`` are always integers, while the value of ``data`` can
    be a boolean, integer, float, string, list, or dictionary.

    All MWorks-specific functions are pre-imported in to the ``__main__``
    module, in which the user-provided Python file or string executes.  To use
    them in other modules, import them from ``mworkscore``, e.g.

    .. code:: python

        from mworkscore import getvar, setvar

    .. rubric:: Execution Environment

    All user-provided Python code is executed within Python's ``__main__``
    module. This means that any variables, functions, classes, etc. defined by
    one Python action or resource file are available to all subsequent ones.

    Due to limitations in the Python interpreter, the Python environment is
    *not* reset when a new experiment is loaded.  If your Python code expects to
    run in a "clean slate" environment, it will have to perform the necessary
    cleanup actions itself.

    Also, event callback functions are never unregistered automatically.  They
    must be removed explicitly via ``unregister_event_callbacks()``.
