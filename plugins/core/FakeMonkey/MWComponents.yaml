signature: iodevice/fake_monkey
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
allowed_child: Fake Monkey Channel
description: >
    A simulated monkey that has the ability to generate spikes and continuous
    eye position data
parameters: 
  - 
    name: spike_rate
    default: 25
    description: >
        Average rate of spike generation (spikes per second).  The actual times
        between individual spikes are drawn from an `exponential distribution
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution>`_ with lambda
        equal to the specified spike rate.

name: Fake Monkey Eye Channel
signature: iochannel/eye_movement
isa: Fake Monkey Channel
description: >
    Provides simulated raw horizontal and vertical eye position data from a
    `Fake Monkey IO Device`
parameters: 
  - 
    name: eye_h
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store simulated horizontal eye position (in
        degrees)
  - 
    name: eye_v
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store simulated vertical eye position (in degrees)
  - 
    name: data_interval
    required: yes
    example: 1ms
    description: >
        Interval between simulated eye position samples (microseconds)
  - 
    name: update_interval
    required: yes
    example: 10ms
    description: >
        Interval between eye position updates (microseconds).  If larger than
        `data_interval`_, multiple eye positions will be generated during each
        update.

name: Fake Monkey Juice Channel
signature: iochannel/juice
isa: Fake Monkey Channel
description: >
    Simulates dispensing juice to a `Fake Monkey IO Device`
parameters: 
  - 
    name: variable
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable used to trigger simulated juice dispensing.  Whenever the
        variable's value changes, MWorks logs a message (to the event stream and
        server console) indicating that juice was dispensed.
