name: Face Recognizer
signature: iodevice/face_recognizer
isa: IODevice
description: |
    A face recognizer captures images from a camera and uses a `Core ML
    <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml>`_ model to classify them.
    Its intended use is to recognize the faces of specific experimental
    subjects, but the type of classification it performs depends entirely on the
    provided model.  For information on obtaining or creating a suitable model,
    see `Getting a Core ML Model
    <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/getting_a_core_ml_model>`_.

    On macOS, a face recognizer can use any camera (internal or external) that
    is supported by the operating system.  On iOS, it always uses the built-in,
    front-facing, wide-angle camera.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: model_path
    required: yes
    description: |
        Filesystem path to a Core ML image classification model (i.e. a
        ``.mlmodel`` file).

        *Note*: The experiment must also declare the model file as a `File
        Resource`, e.g.::

            resource ('my_model.mlmodel')

            iodevice/face_recognizer my_recognizer (
                model_path = 'my_model.mlmodel'
                ...
                )
  - 
    name: region_of_interest
    default: '[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]'
    description: |
        Region of the image on which to perform classification.

        The value of this parameter should be a four-element list of the form
        ``[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]``, where *(x_min, y_min)* and *(x_max,
        y_max)* are the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners,
        respectively, of the region of interest.  Each coordinate must be
        normalized to the dimensions of the image and lie between 0.0 and 1.0
        (inclusive).

        If this parameter is set to the name of a variable, the variable's value
        can be changed at any time, even while the recognizer is running.  This
        enables run-time refinement of recognizer performance via changes
        to the region of interest.

        If this parameter is omitted, its value is not a list, or its value is
        an empty list, the entire image is used as input to the classifier.
  - 
    name: minimum_confidence
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Minimum confidence for a classification result to be considered valid.
        Must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 1 is most confident.
  - 
    name: result_history
    default: 1
    description: |
        Number of most recent classifications to consider when applying
        `required_matches`_. Must be greater than or equal to 1.
  - 
    name: required_matches
    default: 1
    description: |
        Number of most recent classifications that must give the same result in
        order for that result to be considered valid.  Must be between 1 and the
        value of `result_history`_ (inclusive).

        For example, if ``required_matches`` is 9, and ``result_history`` is 10,
        then 9 of the 10 most recent classification results must yield the same
        identifier in order for its value to be reported via the `identifier`_
        parameter.
  - 
    name: identifier
    required: yes
    description: |
        Variable in which to store the most recent classification result (as a
        string), subject to `minimum_confidence`_ and `required_matches`_.  If
        classification fails to produce a valid result, the variable is set to
        an empty string.
  - 
    name: confidence
    required: no
    description: |
        Variable in which to store the reported confidence for the most recent
        classification result.  The value will be between 0.0 and 1.0
        (inclusive), where 1 is most confident.

        *Note*: The exact meaning of the confidence value depends on the model.
        If the model does not support confidence estimation, the value will
        always be 1.
  - 
    name: camera_unique_id
    required: no
    description: |
        If this parameter is omitted, and multiple cameras are detected, the
        face recognizer will fail to initialize.  The error message reporting
        the failure will include the names and unique ID's of all available
        cameras.  To allow initialization to succeed, set the value of this
        parameter to the unique ID of the desired camera.

        *Note*: This parameter is ignored on iOS, where the built-in,
        front-facing, wide-angle camera is always used.
  - 
    name: image_capture_interval
    required: yes
    example: 250ms
    description: |
        Time interval between image captures.  Must be greater than zero.
  - 
    name: image_logging_interval
    default: 0
    example: 60s
    description: |
        If greater than zero, determines the rate at which captured images are
        stored in the variable specified by `image_data`_.

        By enabling image logging, you can capture additional images of
        experimental subjects that can later be used to improve your model. In
        addition, MWClient's Image Viewer window can display the logged images
        and provides a convenient interface for viewing and altering the current
        value of `region_of_interest`_.
  - 
    name: image_data
    required: no
    description: |
        Variable in which to store logged images, as controlled by
        `image_logging_interval`_.  Each image is stored as a string containing
        `JPEG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>`_-encoded data.
