name: Video Stimulus
signature: stimulus/video
isa: [Basic Transform Stimulus, Dynamic Stimulus Base]
description: |
    A stimulus that plays a video stored in any `video file format
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format>`_ supported by the
    operating system.

    *Note*:  To preserve the video's aspect ratio on screen, `x_size`_ and
    `y_size`_ must be equal.  When drawn, the larger dimension spans the full
    specified size, while the smaller dimension is scaled to maintain the
    aspect ratio.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: path
    required: yes
    description: Filesystem path to the video file
  - 
    name: volume
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Output audio volume (floating-point value between 0 and 1, where 0 is
        muted and 1 is full system volume)
  - 
    name: loop
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the video will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic
        Stimulus` is invoked)
  - 
    name: repeats
    default: 0
    description: |
        Number of times to repeat the video.  Note that the video will always
        play at least once, even if this value is less than one.

        If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.
  - 
    name: ended
    description: >
        Variable that will be set to true after the video ends.  If `repeats`_
        is greater than 1, the variable will be set only once, after all
        repetitions are complete.  If `loop`_ is ``YES``, the variable will
        never be set.
