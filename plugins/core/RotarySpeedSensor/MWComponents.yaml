name: Rotary Speed Sensor
signature: iodevice/rotary_speed_sensor
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
description: Interface to a rotary speed sensor
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_port
    example: /dev/cu.usbmodem23301
    description: |
        Filesystem path that represents the serial port to which the rotary
        speed sensor is connected.

        If omitted, MWorks looks for a single, connected serial device.  If it
        finds one, it assumes it to be the desired rotary speed sensor and
        attempts to connect.
  - 
    name: direction
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store the direction reported by the sensor.  The
        direction value is always 0 or 1.
  - 
    name: rpm
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store the rotational speed reported by the sensor.
        The rotational speed value is an integer ranging from 0 to 254
        (inclusive) in units of revolutions per minute (RPM).
  - 
    name: reconnect_interval
    default: 0
    example: 10s
    description: |
        If the rotary speed sensor disconnects unexpectedly (e.g. due to power
        failure), and the value of this parameter is greater than zero, then
        MWorks will attempt to reconnect at this interval.

        For example, if this parameter is set to ``10s``, then, upon
        disconnection, MWorks will wait for 10 seconds and then try to
        reconnect.  If the reconnection attempt fails, MWorks will wait for
        another 10 seconds, then try again, and so on.

        If the value of this parameter is zero, MWorks will never attempt to
        reconnect.
