name: QCUALOR Device
signature: iodevice/qcualor
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
description: |
    Interface to a University of Washington Quad Channel Laser Modulator
    (QCUALOR) device.

    This component allows an MWorks experiment to configure the modulator and,
    optionally, active/deactivate it.  See `meg_state`_ for more information.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_port
    example: /dev/cu.usbmodem11201
    description: |
        Filesystem path that represents the serial port to which the QCUALOR
        device is connected.

        If omitted, MWorks looks for a single, connected serial device.  If it
        finds one, it assumes it to be the desired QCUALOR device and attempts
        to connect.

    name: mode_1
    options: [continuous, sinusoidal, inverse_sinusoidal, square, 'off']
    default: 'off'
    description: Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 1
  - 
    name: mode_2
    default: 'off'
    description: >
        Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 2.  Support the same options as
        `mode_1`_.
  - 
    name: mode_3
    default: 'off'
    description: >
        Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 3.  Support the same options as
        `mode_1`_.

    name: mode_4
    default: 'off'
    description: >
        Mode (i.e. waveform) for channel 4.  Support the same options as
        `mode_1`_.
  - 
    name: modulation_frequency
    default: 0.5
    description: |
        Modulation frequency (in hertz).  Must be between 0.5 and 500.

        The modulator supports a fixed set of modulation frequencies, indexed by
        integers ranging from 0 to 255.  MWorks converts the requested
        frequency to an index via the following equation, where ``log`` is the
        natural logarithm::

            index = round(255.0 * log(frequency / 0.5) / log(500.0 / 0.5))

  - 
    name: gain_1
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 1.  Must be between 0 and
        `max_gain`_.
  - 
    name: gain_2
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 2.  Must be between 0 and
        `max_gain`_.
  - 
    name: gain_3
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 3.  Must be between 0 and
        `max_gain`_.
  - 
    name: gain_4
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Gain (i.e. amplitude) for channel 4.  Must be between 0 and
        `max_gain`_.
  - 
    name: max_gain
    default: 0.8
    description: >
        Maximum allowed gain for each channel.  Must be between 0 and 1.
  - 
    name: meg_state
    description: |
        Variable which is set to true by `Start IO Device` and false by `Stop IO
        Device`.

        If the same variable is used to set the state of a digital output line
        (e.g. via a `DATAPixx Bit Output Channel`), and said output line is
        connected to the QCUALOR device's Modulation Enable Gate (MEG), then
        `Start IO Device` will configure and activate the modulator, and
        `Stop IO Device` will deactivate it.

        If this parameter is omitted, or if the assigned variable does *not*
        control a digital output connected to the device's MEG input, then
        `Start IO Device` will send the configuration commands to the
        modulator, but the experiment must explicitly set the MEG state to high
        to apply the configuration and activate the device.  Similarly, `Stop
        IO Device` will send commmands to set all channel modes to "off" and
        gains to zero, but the experiment must explicitly set the MEG state to
        low to deactivate the modulator.
  - 
    name: log_commands
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, log all commands sent to and responses received from the
        device to the MWorks event stream and server console
