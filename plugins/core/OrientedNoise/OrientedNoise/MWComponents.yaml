name: Oriented Noise Stimulus
signature: stimulus/oriented_noise
isa: [Colored Transform Stimulus, Dynamic Stimulus Base]
description: >
    An oriented noise stimulus, as described in `Orientation discrimination in
    human vision: Psychophysics and modeling
    <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2005.10.016>`_ (Beaudot and Mullen,
    2005).
parameters: 
  - 
    name: f_0
    required: yes
    description: >
        Peak spatial frequency.  Must be greater than or equal to zero.
  - 
    name: sigma_f
    required: yes
    description: >
        Standard deviation of spatial frequency around `f_0`_.  Must be greater
        than zero.
  - 
    name: theta_0
    required: yes
    description: >
        Peak orientation (degrees).  Must be between 0 and 180 (inclusive).
  - 
    name: sigma_theta
    required: yes
    description: >
        Standard deviation of orientation around `theta_0`_ (degrees).  Must be
        greater than zero and less than or equal to 90.
  - 
    name: directory_path
    description: |
        Path to directory containing base noise images.  The images must be of
        uniform width and height. Additionally, the width and height (in pixels)
        of each image must be a power of two.

        If omitted, random base noise will be generated every time the stimulus
        is drawn.
  - 
    name: noise_image_selection
    options:
      - sequential
      - random_with_replacement
      - random_without_replacement
    default: random_with_replacement
    description: >
        Method used to select base noise images from `directory_path`_.  If
        ``sequential`` is specified, images will be selected in lexicographic
        order by filename.
  - 
    name: rand_seed
    description: >
        Seed value for the random number generator.  If omitted, the current
        system time in nanoseconds is used.
