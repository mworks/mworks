name: Parametric Shape Stimulus
signature: stimulus/parametric_shape
isa: Colored Transform Stimulus
description: |
    A user-defined, two-dimensional shape stimulus.

    The shape is defined by a list of `vertices`_.  By default, the outline of
    the shape is computed via a cubic B-spline approximation, for which the
    vertices serve as control points, resulting in a smooth edge.  However, if
    `spline_resolution`_ is set to zero, the provided vertices are used as-is
    and connected with straight line segments, producing a polygon.  Once the
    shape's outline has been established, the interior is filled with the
    specified `color`_.

    *Note*: The outline of the shape is determined when the stimulus is loaded.
    To change the value of `vertices`_ or `spline_resolution`_ while the
    experiment is running, you must `unload <Unload Stimulus>` the stimulus,
    change the desired parameter, then `reload <Load Stimulus>` the stimulus.

    .. rubric:: Vertex Coordinates

    The coordinate grid on which the shape's vertices lie is a square with
    center given by `vertex_coord_center_x`_ and `vertex_coord_center_y`_ and
    edge length given by `vertex_coord_range`_.  If any of these parameters is
    omitted, its value is inferred from the other parameters (if present) and
    the bounding box of the shape, i.e. the smallest rectangle that encloses
    the entire shape.  Note that if `spline_resolution`_ is non-zero, the
    bounding box is determined from the spline approximation of the shape edge,
    not the raw vertices.

    *Note*: Since the coordinate grid is always square, setting `x_size`_ and
    `y_size`_ to different values will stretch the shape along the larger
    dimension.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: vertices
    required: yes
    example: '[[-2, -2], [0, 2], [0, 0], [2, -2], [0, -1], [-2, -2]]'
    description: |
        Set of points that define the shape, in arbitrary coordinates
        (see above).  Must be a list of two or more sub-lists, with each
        sub-list containing two numbers.
  - 
    name: spline_resolution
    default: 50
    description: |
        Number of points in the cubic B-spline approximation computed from
        `vertices`_.  Higher values will produce a smoother edge.

        Must be greater than or equal to zero.  If zero, no spline approximation
        is computed, and the provided vertices are connected with straight
        line segments.
  - 
    name: vertex_coord_center_x
    description: >
        x coordinate of the center of the vertex coordinate grid (see above for
        details)
  - 
    name: vertex_coord_center_y
    description: >
        y coordinate of the center of the vertex coordinate grid (see above for
        details)
  - 
    name: vertex_coord_range
    description: >
        Edge length of the vertex coordinate grid (see above for details)
  - 
    name: margin_pixels
    default: 0
    description: |
        Number of pixels at the edge of the stimulus rectangle (i.e. the region
        specified by `x_size`_, `y_size`_ `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and
        `rotation`_) that are *not* drawn on.  Must be a floating-point number
        greater than or equal to zero.

        If parts of the shape at the edge of the vertex coordinate grid appear
        rough or truncated, increasing the number of margin pixels may
        eliminate the issue.
  - 
    name: use_antialiasing
    default: 'YES'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, anti-aliasing will be used to smooth the rendered edges of
        the shape
  - 
    name: max_size_x
    description: |
        Maximum horizontal size (degrees).

        If omitted, the maximum horizontal size is set to the value of `x_size`_
        when the stimulus is loaded.
  - 
    name: max_size_y
    description: |
        Maximum vertical size (degrees).

        If omitted, the maximum vertical size is set to the value of `y_size`_
        when the stimulus is loaded.
