name: Optic Flow Field Stimulus
signature: stimulus/optic_flow_field
isa: [Colored Transform Stimulus, Dynamic Stimulus Base]
description: |
    A stimulus that simulates the view of an observer moving through a
    three-dimensional field of dots (or, equivalently, the view of a stationary
    observer in a field of moving dots).

    The dot field is implemented as a sphere with the observer at the center.
    `Perspective projection
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection>`_ is
    used to map the dots on to the two-dimensional screen. The observer's field
    of view is the `viewing frustum
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum>`_ defined by `x_size`_,
    `y_size`_, `z_near`_, and `z_far`_; the vertices of the far base of the
    frustum lie on the sphere.  The apparent direction of motion is specified
    in `horizontal coordinates
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system>`_ by
    `direction_altitude`_ and `direction_azimuth`_.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: z_near
    required: yes
    example: 10
    description: |
        Distance to the near plane of the `viewing frustum
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum>`_ (degrees, i.e. same
        units as `x_size`_ and `y_size`_)
  - 
    name: z_far
    required: yes
    example: 30
    description: |
        Distance to the far plane of the `viewing frustum
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum>`_ (degrees, i.e. same
        units as `x_size`_ and `y_size`_)
  - 
    name: dot_density
    required: yes
    description: Average number of dots per square degree on screen
  - 
    name: dot_size
    required: yes
    description: Dot diameter (degrees)
  - 
    name: direction_altitude
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Altitude angle of direction of motion, in degrees between -90 and 90
        (inclusive).

        Along with `direction_azimuth`_, this parameter specifies the direction
        of motion (or, more precisely, the direction from which coherent dots
        come) in `horizontal coordinates
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system>`_.  If the
        alititude and azimuth are both zero, the motion is directly in to the
        screen (or, equivalently, the dots come directly *out* of the screen).
  - 
    name: direction_azimuth
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Azimuth angle of direction of motion, in degrees between -180 and 180
        (inclusive).

        For more information, see `direction_altitude`_.
  - 
    name: speed
    required: yes
    description: Dot speed (degrees per second)
  - 
    name: coherence
    default: 1.0
    description: >
        Fraction of dots that appear to come from the direction specified by
        `direction_altitude`_ and `direction_azimuth`_.  Non-coherent dots
        receive random directions.
  - 
    name: lifetime
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Dot lifetime (seconds).  When a dot reaches the end of its lifetime, it
        is removed and replaced by a new dot in a random location.

        If set to zero, dots have an infinite lifetime.
  - 
    name: max_num_dots
    description: |
        Maximum number of dots.

        If omitted, the maximum number of dots is computed from the other
        parameters when the stimulus is loaded.  Setting it explicitly to a
        larger value makes it possible to increase dot density or stimulus size
        while the experiment is running.
  - 
    name: rand_seed
    description: >
        Seed value for the random number generator.  If omitted, the current
        system time in nanoseconds is used.
