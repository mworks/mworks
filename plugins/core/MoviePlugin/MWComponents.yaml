name: Base Frame List Stimulus
abstract: yes
isa: [Stimulus, Dynamic Stimulus Base]
parameters: 
  - 
    name: ended
    description: >
        Variable that will be set to true after the last frame has displayed.
        (Specifically, it will be set to true at the time that the next frame
        *after* the last would have been drawn, if there were one.)
  - 
    name: loop
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the presentation will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop
        Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)
  - 
    name: repeats
    default: 0
    description: |
        Number of times to repeat the presentation.  Note that the presentation
        will always run at least once, even if this value is less than one.

        If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.

name: Frame List Stimulus
signature: stimulus/frame_list
isa: Base Frame List Stimulus
allowed_child:
  - Replicator
  - Stimulus
description: >
    A simple movie stimulus that presents its frames at the native refresh rate
    of the display.  The frames can be provided by a stimulus group or attached
    directly to the frame list as child components.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: stimulus_group
    description: Stimulus group providing the frames
  - 
    name: ending
    description: >
        Variable that will be set to true when the frame list begins drawing its
        last frame (thereby notifying you of the optimal time to `queue <Queue
        Stimulus>`  stimuli that should be displayed during the frame
        *immediately following* said last frame)

name: Base Movie Stimulus
abstract: yes
isa: Base Frame List Stimulus
parameters: 
  - 
    name: frames_per_second
    required: yes
    description: Rate at which to display the movie's frames

name: Movie Stimulus
signature: stimulus/movie
isa: Base Movie Stimulus
allowed_child:
  - Replicator
  - Stimulus
description: |
    A simple movie stimulus that presents its frames at a specified frame rate.
    The frames can be provided by a stimulus group or attached directly to the
    movie as child components.

    *Note*:  For compatibility with previous MWorks versions, this stimulus
    ignores the `deferred`_ parameter.  Instead, the stimulus instance itself is
    marked as loaded at creation (as if `deferred`_ were ``no``), but it does
    not automatically load its frame stimuli (as if `deferred`_ were
    ``explicit``).  However, explicit `load <Load Stimulus>` and `unload <Unload
    Stimulus>` actions *will* load/unload the frames along with the movie
    stimulus itself.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: stimulus_group
    description: Stimulus group providing the frames

name: Image Directory Movie Stimulus
signature: stimulus/image_directory_movie
isa: Base Movie Stimulus
description: |
    A movie stimulus that gets its frames from a directory of image files.

    *Note*:  To preserve each image's aspect ratio on screen, `x_size`_ and
    `y_size`_ must be equal.  When drawn, the larger dimension spans the full
    specified size, while the smaller dimension is scaled to maintain the
    aspect ratio.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: directory_path
    required: yes
    description: |
        Filesystem path to the directory containing the image files.

        *All* non-hidden files in this directory must be images.  The frames are
        ordered according to the lexical sort order of the file names.
  - 
    name: x_size
    example: 5.0
    description: |
        Horizontal size (degrees).

        If omitted, the value of `y_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
        x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).
  - 
    name: y_size
    example: 5.0
    description: |
        Vertical size (degrees).

        If omitted, the value of `x_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
        x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).
  - 
    name: x_position
    default: 0.0
    description: Horizontal center position (degrees)
  - 
    name: y_position
    default: 0.0
    description: Vertical center position (degrees)
  - 
    name: rotation
    default: 0.0
    description: Rotation (degrees)
  - 
    name: alpha_multiplier
    default: 1.0
    description: >
        Controls the transparency of the stimulus.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque,
        while ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.
  - 
    name: fullscreen
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the stimulus is sized to fill the display.  In this mode,
        `x_size`_, `y_size`_, `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and `rotation`_ are
        ignored.
