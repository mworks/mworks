name: Firmata Device
signature: iodevice/firmata
isa: IODevice
allowed_child: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Interface to a microcontroller that supports the
    `Firmata protocol <https://github.com/firmata/protocol>`_.

    Most `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_ boards and compatible devices
    (e.g. `Teensy <http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/>`_) can be configured to support
    the Firmata protocol via the Arduino
    `Firmata library <https://github.com/firmata/arduino>`_.

    The device can be connected via a serial port or `Bluetooth low energy
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy>`_ (BLE).  If both
    `serial_port`_ and `bluetooth_local_name`_ are omitted, MWorks looks for a
    single, connected serial device.  If it finds one, it assumes it to be the
    desired Firmata device and attempts to connect.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_port
    example: /dev/cu.usbmodem31
    description: |
        If the Firmata device is connected via a serial port, this parameter
        specifies the filesystem path that represents the serial port
  - 
    name: bluetooth_local_name
    example: FIRMATA
    description: |
        If the Firmata device is connected via Bluetooth low energy, this
        parameter specifies its local name
  - 
    name: data_interval
    example: 5ms
    description: >
        Sampling interval for analog inputs.  Must be a whole number of
        milliseconds.
  - 
    name: connected
    description: |
        Variable in which to store connection state of the Firmata device (true
        if currently connected, false otherwise).

        Normally, the device should be connected at all times.  However, by
        monitoring the value of the specified variable, you can detect and
        respond to unexpected disconnections.
  - 
    name: reconnect_interval
    default: 0
    example: 10s
    description: |
        If the Firmata device disconnects unexpectedly (e.g. due to power
        failure), and the value of this parameter is greater than zero, then the
        device will attempt to reconnect at this interval.

        For example, if this parameter is set to ``10s``, then, upon
        disconnection, the device will wait for 10 seconds and then try to
        reconnect.  If the reconnection attempt fails, the device will wait for
        another 10 seconds, then try again, and so on.

        If the value of this parameter is zero, the device will never attempt to
        reconnect.

name: Firmata Analog Output Channel
signature: iochannel/firmata_analog_output
isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Analog output channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    *Note*:  Most Firmata-compatible devices do not support true analog output.
    Instead, they simulate it using `pulse-width modulation
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>`_ (PWM).  Therefore,
    the actual output voltage will cycle between the minimum and maximum
    voltages supported by the device, producing a time-average voltage that
    approximates the desired value.

isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Digital input pullup channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    Unlike a standard `digital input channel <Firmata Digital Input Channel>`,
    a digital input pullup channel enables the built-in pullup resistor for its
    associated pin.  This causes the input to be high/true when unconnected and
    low/false when connected to ground. For more information, see the Arduino
    documentation on  `digital pins
    <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins>`_.

name: Firmata Digital Input Pulse Channel
signature: iochannel/firmata_digital_input_pulse
isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Digital input pulse channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    A digital input pulse channel measures the duration of input "pulses" on its
    associated pin.  Whenever the pin transitions to high/true, the Firmata
    device records the pulse start time (as measured by its onboard clock). 
    When the pin transitions back to low/false, the device subtracts the start
    time from the current time and reports the elapsed duration to MWorks.

    *Note*: Firmata devices always report pulse durations in milliseconds. 
    MWorks converts these to microseconds before assigning them to `value`_.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: pin_number
    required: yes
    example: 13

name: Firmata Digital Output Pulse Channel
signature: iochannel/firmata_digital_output_pulse
isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Digital output pulse channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    A digital output pulse channel triggers output "pulses" on its associated
    pin.  Whenever a pulse duration is assigned to `value`_, MWorks sends a
    pulse command to the Firmata device.  Upon receiving the command, the device
    sets the pin to high/true.  Once the requested interval (as measured by the
    device's onboard clock) has elapsed, the device sets the pin back to
    low/false.

    *Note*: Firmata devices require pulse durations to be specified in
    milliseconds.  MWorks converts durations assigned to `value`_ from
    microseconds to milliseconds before sending them to the device.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: pin_number
    required: yes

    description: Output pin number
  - 
    name: value
    required: yes
    description: |
        Variable from which to read pulse duration (in microseconds). 
        `Assigning <Assign Variable>` a value to the variable causes the pulse
        to begin immediately.
