name: Firmata Device
signature: iodevice/firmata
isa: IODevice
allowed_child: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Interface to a microcontroller that supports the
    `Firmata protocol <https://github.com/firmata/protocol>`_.

    Most `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_ boards and compatible devices
    (e.g. `Teensy <http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/>`_) can be configured to support
    the Firmata protocol via the Arduino
    `Firmata library <https://github.com/firmata/arduino>`_.

    The device can be connected via a serial port or `Bluetooth low energy
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy>`_ (BLE).  If both
    `serial_port`_ and `bluetooth_local_name`_ are omitted, MWorks looks for a
    single, connected serial device.  If it finds one, it assumes it to be the
    desired Firmata device and attempts to connect.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: serial_port
    example: /dev/cu.usbmodem31
    description: |
        If the Firmata device is connected via a serial port, this parameter
        specifies the filesystem path that represents the serial port
  - 
    name: bluetooth_local_name
    example: FIRMATA
    description: |
        If the Firmata device is connected via Bluetooth low energy, this
        parameter specifies its local name
  - 
    name: data_interval
    example: 5ms
    description: >
        Sampling interval for analog inputs.  Must be a whole number of
        milliseconds.

isa: Firmata Channel
description: Analog input channel on a `Firmata Device`
parameters: 
  - 
    name: pin_number
    required: yes
    example: [a0, A3, 17]
    description: Input pin number
  - 
    name: value
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store input values.  The value is always between 0
        and 1 (inclusive) and indicates the fraction of the device's operating
        voltage (typically 5V or 3.3V) measured on the input pin.

name: Firmata Analog Output Channel
signature: iochannel/firmata_analog_output
isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Analog output channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    *Note*:  Most Firmata-compatible devices do not support true analog output.
    Instead, they simulate it using `pulse-width modulation
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>`_ (PWM).  Therefore,
    the actual output voltage will cycle between the minimum and maximum
    voltages supported by the device, producing a time-average voltage that
    approximates the desired value.

  - 
    name: pin_number
    required: yes
    example: 3
    description: Output pin number
  - 
    name: value
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable from which to read output values.  The value must be between 0
        and 1 (inclusive) and indicates the fraction of the device's operating
        voltage (typically 5V or 3.3V) to output on the specified pin.

name: Firmata Digital Input Pullup Channel
signature: iochannel/firmata_digital_input_pullup
isa: Firmata Channel
description: |
    Digital input pullup channel on a `Firmata Device`.

    Unlike a standard `digital input channel <Firmata Digital Input Channel>`,
    a digital input pullup channel enables the built-in pullup resistor for its
    associated pin.  This causes the input to be high/true when unconnected and
    low/false when connected to ground. For more information, see the Arduino
    documentation on  `digital pins
    <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins>`_.
