name: Drifting Grating Stimulus
signature: stimulus/drifting_grating
isa: [Colored Transform Stimulus, Dynamic Stimulus Base]
description: A drifting grating stimulus
parameters: 
  - 
    name: direction
    default: 0.0
    description: Direction of drift (degrees)
  - 
    name: starting_phase
    default: 0.0
    description: Starting phase (degrees)
  - 
    name: spatial_frequency
    required: yes
    example: 1
    description: Spatial frequency (cycles per degree)
  - 
    name: speed
    required: yes
    example: 1
    description: Drift speed (degrees per second)
  - 
    name: compute_phase_incrementally
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``NO``, the current phase of the grating is computed from
        `starting_phase`_, `spatial_frequency`_, `speed`_, and the total time
        elapsed  since the stimulus started playing.

        If ``YES``, the current phase is computed from the previous phase (i.e.
        the phase when the stimulus was last drawn), `spatial_frequency`_,
        `speed`_, and the time elapsed since the previous phase was computed.

        This parameter is relevant only when the stimulus is `live queued <Live
        Queue Stimulus>` and the values of `starting_phase`_,
        `spatial_frequency`_, and/or `speed`_ are changed while the stimulus is
        playing.  Most notably, if the parameter's value is ``NO``, then changes
        to `speed`_ will cause a discontinuous jump in phase.  If the value is
        ``YES``, then changes to `speed`_ will be smooth, with no phase jump.

    name: grating_type
    required: yes
    options: [sinusoid, square, triangle, sawtooth]
    description: Grating type
  - 
    name: mask
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, the grating will function as a mask (similar to a `Mask
        Stimulus`).  When used as part of a `layer <Layer Stimulus>`, "high"
        regions of the grating (where the value is close to one) will allow
        stimuli beneath it in the layer to show through, while "low" regions
        (where the value is near zero) will partially or fully erase such
        stimuli, exposing any stimuli beneath the layer.

        When the value of this parameter is ``YES``, `color`_ and
        `alpha_multiplier`_ are ignored.

        *Note*: For compatibility with existing experiments, the value of this
        parameter can also be one of ``rectangle``, ``ellipse``, or
        ``gaussian``, in which case it specifies the type of mask to apply to
        the grating.  However, this usage is deprecated, and new experiments
        should use a `Mask Stimulus` instead.

    name: inverted
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, all grating values are inverted, e.g. high values become
        low, and low values become high
  - 
    name: std_dev
    default: 1.0
    deprecated: yes
    description: Standard deviation of Gaussian mask
  - 
    name: mean
    default: 0.0
    deprecated: yes
    description: |
        Mean of Gaussian mask.

        This value determines the radial offset of the Gaussian peak from the
        center of the grating.  If non-zero, the peak will be a circle, rather
        than a point, and luminance will decrease both inside and outside the
        circle, producing a toroidal stimulus.
  -
    name: normalized
    default: 'YES'
    deprecated: yes
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the Gaussian mask includes a multiplicative normalization
        term (``1/(std_dev*sqrt(2*pi))``).  If ``NO``, this term is omitted.
